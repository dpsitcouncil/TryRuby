### To make your program shorter
If you have to do the same thing in more than one part of your code it is easier
to put that code in a separate method. Your code will be shorter.

### To make your code easier to read
Suppose your program needs to do a lot of different things.
You __could__ stuff all code into one long piece. But it would be very difficult to
read and understand that code later.

Instead you should cut up your code in different methods and give each method an easy to
understand English name. You will thank yourself later.

So how do we define a method? Like this:

    def tame( number_of_shrews )
    end
