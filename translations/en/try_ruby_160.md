You've hung on to your lotto numbers, tucking them away inside a __variable__ called ticket.
But any other name, like _jimmyslist_, would have been fine too.

Programming, you will discover, is mostly about working with variables.

Let's put your lotto numbers in order, how about?

Use: 

    ticket.sort!
    
You had a list. You sorted the list. The ticket variable is now changed.
