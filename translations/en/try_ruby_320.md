### Parentheses
Actually, most of the time Ruby doesn't mind if you omit the parentheses. So this would have
worked too:
__poem.gsub "toast", "honeydew"__

We have already used another method with a parameter. Many times in fact, though it was not very obvious:

    puts "Hello"
    puts("Hello")

Yes __puts__ is also a method. Using puts with or without parentheses is the same to Ruby, but the version without parentheses is a bit easier to read. And it saves you valuable typing time!

### to (be) or not to (be)
So if _to_ is a method and _be_ is an argument we now know the answer to this age old question.
It is really just a matter of preference whether you want _to be_ or _to(be)_.
